## The Problem

Many Thunderbird users:

- 📧 Handle repeat conversations with the same people
- 🧠 Rely on mental context ("this client is important", "slow to pay", "VIP", "legal risk", etc.)
- ⏰ Lose that context over time or across team members

## The Solution

**Sender Notes** lets you attach notes to email senders. When you open an email, your note appears automatically as a banner at the top of the message.

✅ Simple  
✅ High-signal  
✅ Immediately useful  
✅ No external services or accounts required

## Features

### 📝 Flexible Note Matching

Create notes that match emails in different ways:

| Match Type | Example Pattern | Matches |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Exact** | `john@example.com` | Only that specific email |
| **Starts With** | `john.` | `john.doe@example.com`, `john.smith@test.com` |
| **Ends With** | `@example.com` | All emails from that domain |
| **Contains** | `acme` | Any email containing "acme" |

### 🏷️ Multiple Notes Per Sender

Apply multiple notes to the same email. For example:
- An exact match note: "Primary contact for Project X"
- A domain note: "Acme Corp - Net 30 payment terms"

Both banners display when viewing emails from that sender.

### ⚡ Quick Notes / Templates

Speed up your workflow with pre-defined templates:
- "VIP - Respond within 24 hours 🔥"
- "Slow payer - Follow up on invoices"
- Create your own custom templates

### 🎨 Visual Banners

Notes appear as non-intrusive banners at the top of the message pane:
- Distinct yellow background (adapts to dark mode)
- Shows the match type and pattern
- Click any banner to edit the note
- Supports multi-line formatting

### 🔒 Privacy First

- All notes stored locally in Thunderbird
- No external servers or accounts
- Your data stays on your machine

Help make Sender Notes available in more languages! Here's how:

1. **Copy an existing translation folder**
   - Navigate to `_locales/en/` (English) as a template
   - Create a new folder with your language code (e.g., `_locales/fr/` for French)

2. **Translate the messages.json file**
   - Copy `messages.json` from the `en` folder to your new folder
   - Translate only the `"message"` values, not the keys
   - Keep placeholders like `$1`, `$COUNT$` unchanged

3. **Example structure:**
   ```
   _locales/
   ├── en/
   │   └── messages.json  (English - default)
   ├── el/
   │   └── messages.json  (Greek)
   └── fr/
       └── messages.json  (French - your new translation)
   ```

4. **Test your translation**
   - Load the addon in Thunderbird
   - Go to Settings and select your language
   - Verify all UI elements display correctly

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Include your new `_locales/[lang]/messages.json` file
   - We'll review and merge your contribution!
