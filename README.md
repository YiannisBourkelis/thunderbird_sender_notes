## What It Does

**Sender Notes** lets you attach notes to email senders. When you open an email, your note appears automatically as a banner at the top of the message—reminding you of important context like "important client", "complaint history", "appointment no-show", or anything else you need to remember.

✅ Simple — right-click any email to add a note  
✅ Automatic — notes appear when you need them  
✅ Private — all data stays in your Thunderbird  
✅ Flexible — match by exact email, domain, or pattern

## Features

### 📝 Flexible Note Matching

Create notes that match emails in different ways:

| Match Type | Example Pattern | Matches |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Exact** | `john@example.com` | Only that specific email |
| **Starts With** | `john.` | `john.doe@example.com`, `john.smith@test.com` |
| **Ends With** | `@example.com` | All emails from that domain |
| **Contains** | `acme` | Any email containing "acme" |

### 🏷️ Multiple Notes Per Sender

Apply multiple notes to the same email. For example:
- An exact match note: "Primary contact for Project X"
- A domain note: "Acme Corp - Net 30 payment terms"

Both banners display when viewing emails from that sender.

### ⚡ Quick Notes / Templates

Speed up your workflow with pre-defined templates. Sender Notes helps you capture important context about your contacts that you'll need the next time they email you.

#### Template Categories

| Category | Template | How It Helps |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Priority** | Important client - always respond within 24 hours! 🔥 | Key contacts that expect fast responses |
| **Trust & Safety** | Potential spam - verify before responding ⚠️ | Protect yourself from phishing or scams |
| **Trust & Safety** | SPAM - unsubscribe requested ❌ | Track unsubscribe requests you've made |
| **Risk Management** | Complaint history - handle carefully ⚠️ | Approach sensitive contacts with care |
| **Risk Management** | History of aggressive communication - keep record 🛑 | Document difficult interactions |
| **Financial** | Outstanding balance - do not proceed ⚠️ | Avoid extending more credit to debtors |
| **Financial** | Slow payer - request upfront payment 💰 | Protect your cash flow |
| **Relationships** | Old colleague / friend 👋 | Remember personal connections |
| **Communication** | Friendly tone · Informal communication | Match the sender's preferred style |
| **Privacy** | Confidential client - limit internal sharing 🔒 | Handle sensitive information appropriately |
| **Scheduling** | Appointment no-show history - confirm before booking ⚠️ | Reduce wasted time from no-shows |
| **Scheduling** | Frequently late to appointments - allow buffer ⏱️ | Plan your calendar accordingly |
| **Hospitality** | Frequent guest - remember preferences 🛏️ | Provide personalized service |
| **Content Type** | Newsletter - low priority 📰 | Triage your inbox effectively |

#### Creating Custom Templates

The templates above are just starting points. You can:
- Create your own templates tailored to your workflow
- Add templates with domain-specific terminology

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep only the templates you actually use! A short, focused list lets you find and apply notes quickly. You can always delete unused templates in Settings → Quick Notes Templates.

### Contributing Translations

Help make Sender Notes available in more languages! Here's how:

1. **Copy an existing translation folder**
   - Navigate to `_locales/en/` (English) as a template
   - Create a new folder with your language code (e.g., `_locales/fr/` for French)

2. **Translate the messages.json file**
   - Copy `messages.json` from the `en` folder to your new folder
   - Translate only the `"message"` values, not the keys
   - Keep placeholders like `$1`, `$COUNT$` unchanged

3. **Example structure:**
   ```
   _locales/
   ├── en/
   │   └── messages.json  (English - default)
   ├── el/
   │   └── messages.json  (Greek)
   └── fr/
       └── messages.json  (French - your new translation)
   ```

4. **Test your translation**
   - Load the addon in Thunderbird
   - Go to Settings and select your language
   - Verify all UI elements display correctly

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Include your new `_locales/[lang]/messages.json` file
   - We'll review and merge your contribution!
